# Test-Taking System Implementation Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a test-taking system where students can answer questions one by one, similar to a test format.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Question Display
- Questions should be displayed one at a time
- Each question should be clearly visible to the student
- Navigation between questions should be intuitive
- Students should be able to see their progress through the test

### 2. Answer Submission
- Students should be able to submit answers for each question
- The system should validate that an answer is provided before allowing progression
- Students should be able to review and modify their answers before final submission
- Clear feedback should be provided when an answer is submitted

### 3. Test Progress
- Students should be able to see:
  - Current question number
  - Total number of questions
  - Time remaining (if applicable)
  - Questions answered vs. total questions

### 4. Database Requirements
- Create a table to store test results with the following information:
  - Student identification
  - Test identification
  - Question identification
  - Submitted answer
  - Timestamp of submission
  - Score/grade (if applicable)
  - Status of the answer (correct/incorrect)

### 5. User Interface
- Clean and intuitive interface
- Clear navigation controls
- Progress indicator
- Confirmation before final submission
- Ability to review previous answers

### 6. Data Validation
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Validate answer format and content
- Prevent multiple submissions of the same question
- Maintain data integrity in the database

## Technical Considerations

### Database Design
- Design an efficient database schema for storing test results
- Include appropriate indexes for performance
- Implement proper relationships between tables
- Consider data types and constraints

### Security
- Implement proper authentication
- Ensure data privacy
- Prevent unauthorized access to test results
- Secure submission process

### Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Implement efficient data retrieval
- Consider caching strategies
- Handle concurrent users

## Future Enhancements
- Support for different question types
- Time limit implementation
- Automatic grading
- Detailed analytics and reporting
- Export functionality for test results
