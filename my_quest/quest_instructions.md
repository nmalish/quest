# Quest System Instructions

## Overview
The Quest System is a sequential testing platform where students must complete a series of tests in order. Each test completion reveals a unique code that unlocks the next test in the sequence.

## Quest Structure
- Each quest consists of 3 sequential tests
- Tests must be completed in order (Test 1 → Test 2 → Test 3)
- Each test completion reveals a unique code
- The code from the previous test is required to access the next test

## Test Completion Process

1. Log in to the system
2. Navigate to "Available Tests"
3. Select the first test in your quest series
4. Begin the test when ready

3. If you fail:
   - You can retry the test
   - No code will be revealed until you pass

### Unlocking Next Test
1. Return to "Available Tests"
